## **What is Meta_Bot?**

**Meta_Bot** is the culmination of the **MyLLM101** project, an AI chatbot built to:

- **Educate**: Teach users about the principles and techniques behind Large Language Models, including tokenization, transformers, fine-tuning, and more.
- **Demonstrate**: Showcase the pipeline of LLM development, from notebooks and modular frameworks to scalable pipelines and deployment.
- **Mentor**: Provide guidance on machine learning, deep learning, and NLP concepts, with a special focus on the architecture and training of LLMs.

This project embodies the concept of "meta-learning" by creating an AI that understands its own origins and can communicate its development journey to others.

   - Integrated efficient text encoding techniques to handle diverse datasets.

2. **Transformer Architecture**:
   - Built a scalable transformer-based model using **PyTorch**.
   - Implemented attention mechanisms to enhance text understanding and generation.

3. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - Utilized **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** to optimize performance on specific tasks.
   - Applied **Reinforcement Learning** techniques like **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** and **Decision Process Optimization (DPO)** for fine-tuning responses.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Designed robust evaluation metrics to assess accuracy, fluency, and relevance of responses.

5. **Inference Optimization**:
   - Reduced latency and memory usage for faster, more efficient predictions.

6. **Interactive Deployment**:
   - Integrated Meta_Bot into an interactive chatbot platform to provide real-time, context-aware tutoring.
