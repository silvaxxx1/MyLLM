# üî© MyLLM: Modular Framework

## *Structured Components for End-to-End LLM Development*

The `Modules` directory is the **core playground** of MyLLM ‚Äî a fully modular and transparent framework for **building, training, fine-tuning, and deploying LLMs**.

Think of this as a **Hugging Face alternative**, but designed for:

* üîç **Clarity** ‚Äì Clean, hackable code for deep understanding.
* üß™ **Research-first workflows** ‚Äì Perfect for experimenting with new ideas.
* ‚ö° **Modularity** ‚Äì Swap in/out components without breaking the whole pipeline.

## üó∫Ô∏è MyLLM Roadmap

This modular framework works alongside **learning notebooks** to create a full-stack LLM journey.

1. **Learning Phase (Notebooks)**

   * Transformers from scratch
   * Flash Attention, MQA, GQA
   * LoRA & QLoRA
   * RLHF with PPO & DPO
   * KV caching & quantization
   * *And more coming soon‚Ä¶*

   üìí [Notebooks](https://lnkd.in/drkeKUre)

2. **Modular Playground**

   * Targeted experiments using these modules.
   * Each module can be extended or replaced for custom research.
