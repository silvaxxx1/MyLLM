# **MyLLM_Recipes: A Scalable Framework for Building and Fine-Tuning LLMs** üöÄ  

Welcome to **MyLLM_Recipes**, the next evolutionary step in the **MyLLM101** project! This repository is designed to bridge the gap between simple notebook experiments and a scalable, professional-grade framework for working with large language models (LLMs). Think of this as your vanilla version of Hugging Face's Transformers, but with the added advantage of learning every piece of the puzzle as you build it yourself.

## Project Overview üåü  

**MyLLM_Recipes** is all about constructing a powerful, reusable framework to:  

1. **Load Models**: Seamlessly load pretrained models or initialize new ones from scratch.  
2. **Train Models**: Efficiently train LLMs using optimized pipelines for single-GPU, multi-GPU, and advanced configurations.  
3. **Fine-Tune Models**: Adapt pretrained models for specific tasks using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning techniques like PPO and DPO.  
4. **Generate Text**: Utilize cutting-edge generation pipelines for interactive applications and tasks.  
5. **Deploy Models**: Integrate inference capabilities with tools like Gradio for user-friendly deployments.  

This framework will serve as the foundation for the final phase of the **MyLLM101** project, where we‚Äôll build **Meta_Bot**, an AI tutor that can teach others how it was made.
