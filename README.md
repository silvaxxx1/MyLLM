## ⚠️ Work In Progress — Hack at Your Own Risk 🚧

MyLLM isn’t just another library — it’s a **playground for learning and building LLMs from scratch**.
This project was born out of a desire to **fully understand every line of a transformer stack**, from tokenization to RLHF.

Here's what's inside right now:

| Area               | Status                | Description                            |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Notebooks**      | ✅ Stable              | Step-by-step guided learning           |
| **Modules**        | ✅ Stable              | Mini-projects for experimentation      |
| **Core Framework** | ⚙️ Active Development | Pure PyTorch, lightweight, transparent |
| **MetaBot**        | 🛠 Coming Soon        | A chatbot that explains *itself*       |

> **Warning:** Some parts are stable, others are actively evolving.
>
> Use this repo to **explore, experiment, and break things safely** — that's how you learn deeply.

## 🌱 Why MyLLM Exists

There are plenty of libraries out there (Hugging Face, Lightning, etc.), but they hide **too much of the magic**.
I wanted something different:

* **Minimal** – no unnecessary abstractions, no magic.
* **Hackable** – every part of the stack is visible and editable.
* **Research-Friendly** – a place to experiment with cutting-edge techniques like LoRA, QLoRA, PPO, and DPO.
* **From Scratch** – so you *truly* understand the internals.

This is a framework for **engineers who want to think like researchers** and **researchers who want to ship real systems**.

## 🗺 The Three Layers of MyLLM

MyLLM is structured into three progressive layers:

---

### **1️⃣ Interactive Notebooks — Learn by Doing**

The `notebooks/` directory is where you’ll start your journey.
Each notebook builds from scratch, step-by-step, with theory + code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silvaxxx1/MyLLM101.git
cd MyLLM101
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/0.0.WELCOME.ipynb
```

**Topics covered:**

* Building a transformer from first principles
* Attention optimizations (Flash Attention, MQA, GQA)
* Efficient fine-tuning with LoRA & QLoRA
* RLHF algorithms like PPO & DPO
* Inference optimizations (KV caching, quantization)

💡 *Modify the attention mask in the notebook and see how outputs change — hands-on learning at its best.*

---

### **2️⃣ Modular Mini-Projects — Targeted Experiments**

The `modules/` folder is a collection of **self-contained experiments**.

```
MyLLM/
 └── modules/
      ├── data/
      ├── models/
      ├── training/
      ├── finetuning/
      └── inference/
```

Example: Train a small GPT from scratch

```bash
python modules/train_gpt.py --config configs/basic.yml
```

This lets you **experiment on one piece of the puzzle** without touching the whole pipeline.

---

### **3️⃣ The MyLLM Core Framework — Hugging Face, But From Scratch**

The `myllm/` folder is where everything comes together.

**Goals:**

* Clean, minimal APIs
* Full transparency
* Designed for scaling, research, and production

Example usage:

```python
from myllm import LLM, SFTTrainer, DPOTrainer, PPOTrainer, Quantizer

# Load model
llm = LLM.load("checkpoints/my_model.pt")

# Generate
output = llm.generate("Once upon a time in a world of AI,")
print(output)

# Fine-tune with LoRA
sft = SFTTrainer(model=llm, dataset=my_dataset)
sft.train(epochs=3, batch_size=32)

# Preference Optimization
dpo = DPOTrainer(model=llm, dataset=preference_dataset)
dpo.train(epochs=5)

# RLHF with PPO
ppo = PPOTrainer(model=llm, environment=rlhf_env)
ppo.train(iterations=10)

# Quantize for faster inference
quantizer = Quantizer(model=llm)
llm_int8 = quantizer.apply(precision="int8")
```

💡 *Every line here maps to real, visible code — no magic.*

## 🔮 Coming Soon: *MetaBot*

The final vision is **MetaBot** — an interactive chatbot built entirely with MyLLM.

> *A chatbot that not only answers your questions but also **shows you exactly how it works under the hood.***

Built with:

* MyLLM core framework
* Gradio for UI
* Fully open source

## 📍 Roadmap

| Status | Milestone             | Details                               |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ✅      | Interactive Notebooks | Learn LLM fundamentals hands-on       |
| ✅      | Modular Mini-Projects | Build reusable, composable components |
| ⚙️     | MyLLM Core Framework  | Fine-tuning, DPO, PPO, quantization   |

## ⚡ Quick Challenges to Try

* Run a notebook → tweak hyperparameters → watch how the model changes.
* Build a mini GPT that writes **haiku poems**.
* Add a new trainer to the framework (e.g., TRL variant).
* Quantize a model and measure speedup in inference.
* Fork the repo and contribute a new attention mechanism.

## 🙌 Inspiration

This project wouldn’t exist without the incredible work of others:

* [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy) — NanoGPT minimalism
* [Umar Jamil](https://github.com/umarjamil) — Practical LLM tutorials
* [Sebastian Raschka](https://github.com/rasbt) — Deep transformer insights

## 🏁 The Vision

The end goal:
A **transparent, educational, and production-ready LLM stack**
built entirely from scratch, by and for engineers who want to **own every line of their AI system**.

Let's strip away the black boxes and **build the future of LLMs — together.**

### 🌍 Final Note

> MyLLM isn’t about copying Hugging Face.
> It’s about **understanding** it — and then **building something new, from first principles.**

---

This version emphasizes:

* **Learning path clarity** — beginner → advanced → framework.
* **Hackable research** — not just another wrapper library.
* **Engineering depth** — you’re not just calling `.fit()`; you’re building `.fit()` yourself.
* **Positioning MyLLM** as a foundation for serious engineers.
