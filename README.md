## **Project Overview** 🌟

**MyLLM101** is not just about building LLMs; it’s about crafting a learning ecosystem from the ground up. You’ll work through the essential components of LLM development and see the process unfold at every step:

### **Key Phases:**

1. **🔢 Notebooks**: Prototype and experiment with foundational LLM concepts interactively.
2. **🛠️ Modular Framework**: Transition into a clean, reusable code structure for easy maintenance and scalability.
3. **🚀 Scalable Pipeline**: Create a framework that mirrors professional-grade LLM-building libraries for large-scale projects.
4. **🔊 Meta\_Bot**: Deploy your LLM as an interactive chatbot that tutors others about the journey of its own creation.

> **Fun Fact**: **Meta\_Bot** is not just a chatbot—it’s an AI that understands its own architecture and can teach others. This is the ultimate **meta moment** in AI development!
