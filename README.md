# **MyLLM101: Let‚Äôs Build Meta_Bot!** üöÄ

Welcome to **MyLLM101**, your step-by-step guide to building a **Meta_Bot**‚Äîan AI tutor that not only demonstrates the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also knows how it was built and guides you through the process.

This project takes you on a transformative journey, starting with simple notebook implementations, advancing to a modular framework, evolving into a scalable pipeline, and culminating in the creation of **Meta_Bot**‚Äîa chatbot that acts as both the ultimate product and your AI-powered mentor.

## Project Overview üåü

**MyLLM101** isn‚Äôt just about building LLMs; it‚Äôs about crafting a learning ecosystem. Starting from scratch, you‚Äôll work through the core components of LLM development:

1. **Notebooks**: Prototype foundational concepts interactively.
2. **Modular Framework**: Transition into a clean, reusable code structure.
3. **Scalable Pipeline**: Create a framework resembling a professional-grade LLM-building library.
4. **Meta_Bot**: Deploy your LLM as a chatbot capable of tutoring others about the journey of its creation.

**Meta_Bot** represents the full-circle idea where the AI you build becomes your guide, teaching concepts like tokenization, training, fine-tuning, and evaluation‚Äîa true **meta moment**!

## Why MyLLM101? ü§î

- **Learn by Doing**: Start with hands-on notebook experiments, then scale up to modular and pipeline-based approaches.
- **Meta-AI Concept**: Build an AI that knows its origins and can mentor others.
- **Scalable Design**: Designed to grow with your skills, from beginner to advanced.
- **End-to-End Focus**: Covers every stage, from preprocessing data to deploying an interactive AI tutor.
- **Low-Level Frameworks**: We focus on building the project using **low-level libraries like PyTorch**, allowing full control and flexibility, without relying on high-level frameworks. This approach gives you deeper insight into the mechanics behind LLMs and empowers you to fine-tune every aspect of your models.
