## ⚠️ Heads Up! This is a *Work In Progress* 🚧

> 🛠️ Some parts are stable and ready for you to explore, others are actively evolving or experimental.
>
> * **Notebooks:** Interactive tutorials for hands-on learning
> * **Modules:** Modular mini-projects and training scripts
> * **MyLLM Core Framework:** Pure PyTorch, clean, extensible, actively developed
> * **MetaBot Chatbot:** Coming soon — a chatbot that explains *itself*!

**Jump in, experiment, break stuff, learn!** This repo is a sandbox for us all.

---

## 🌟 Ready to Jump In? Start Here!

### 1️⃣ Explore Interactive Notebooks — Your Playground 🧠

* Check out `notebooks/` for step-by-step transformer tutorials.
* Run, tweak, and observe model internals in action.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/silvaxxx1/MyLLM101.git
cd MyLLM101
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/0.0.WELCOME.ipynb
```

*Pro tip:* Modify the attention mask code and see what changes in output!

---

### 2️⃣ Modular Mini-Projects for Experiments 🧩

* Organize reusable components in `modules/`.
* Train small GPTs from scratch quickly:

```bash
python modules/train_gpt.py --config configs/basic.yml
```

---

### 3️⃣ Meet *MyLLM* — The Engine Behind It All ⚙️

* Pure PyTorch native transformer models with minimal dependencies.
* Inspired by LitGPT and Hugging Face for clean APIs and modularity.
* Designed for deep understanding and flexibility in research and production.

---

## 🛠️ MyLLM API Preview — Simple, Familiar, Powerful

```python
from myllm import LLM, SFTTrainer, DPOTTrainer, PPOTrainer, Quantizer

# Load a pretrained or fine-tuned model
llm = LLM.load("my_model_checkpoint")

# Generate text with flexible options
output = llm.generate("Once upon a time, in a world of AI,")
print(output)

# Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
sft = SFTTrainer(model=llm, dataset=my_training_data)
sft.train(epochs=3, batch_size=16)

# Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
dpo = DPOTTrainer(model=llm, dataset=my_preference_data)
dpo.train(epochs=5)

# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for RLHF
ppo = PPOTrainer(model=llm, environment=my_custom_env)
ppo.train(iterations=10)

# Quantization for efficient inference
quantizer = Quantizer(model=llm)
llm_quantized = quantizer.apply(precision="int8")
```

*Experiment combining features: What happens if you quantize before fine-tuning?*

---

### 4️⃣ Coming Soon — *MetaBot* 🤖

* A chatbot that not only talks but *explains how it was built*.
* Built with MyLLM + Gradio UI for smooth interaction.
* Help build this next milestone!

---

## 🚀 Quick Wins & Challenges for You

* Run a notebook, tweak learning rates, observe training dynamics.
* Train a mini GPT, generate text, try making it rhyme!
* Write your own prompts and experiment with completions.
* Fork the repo, add a new trainer (PPO is waiting for you!).
* Help build the Gradio UI for MetaBot — ideas welcome!
