    "# **Notebook 6.2: Understanding KV Cache for Efficient Transformer Inference 🚀**  \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction 📚**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to **Notebook 6.2**, where we dive deep into **KV (Key-Value) Caching**, a crucial optimization technique for making transformer-based models more efficient during inference. 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Notebook 6.1**, we explored **decoding strategies** like greedy search, beam search, and top-k sampling while running inference on a transformer model. However, we noticed a key challenge: **as sequence length increases, inference slows down significantly** due to repeated attention computations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **KV Caching** comes to the rescue! 🚀 Instead of recomputing attention keys and values for every token in the sequence, KV caching **stores and reuses** previously computed states—leading to **massive speedups** in autoregressive decoding (like in GPT models).  \n",

    "1️⃣ **Reviewing Standard Inference (from Notebook 6.1) ⏳**  \n",
    "   - A quick recap of how transformers generate text **without KV caching**.  \n",
    "   - Understanding why inference **becomes slower** as the sequence grows.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2️⃣ **How KV Caching Works: Storing and Reusing Attention States 📦**  \n",
    "   - We'll break down **how transformers compute attention** and **where KV caching fits in**.  \n",
    "   - You'll see how **storing past keys and values** helps speed up token generation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3️⃣ **Implementing KV Cache in a Transformer Decoder ⚡**  \n",
    "   - We'll modify our model to **store past keys & values** in a cache.  \n",
    "   - Instead of recomputing everything, the model will **only process new tokens** efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4️⃣ **Slicing and Updating KV Cache: Hands-on Exploration 🔬**  \n",
    "   - Understanding how to **slice, update, and retrieve** keys/values from the cache.  \n",
    "   - We’ll visualize **tensor slicing** and its role in maintaining an efficient cache.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5️⃣ **Benchmarking Speed: With and Without KV Caching 🚀**  \n",
    "   - We’ll compare inference speeds **with and without KV caching** to see the real impact.  \n",
    "   - Expect **significant improvements**, especially for long sequences!  \n",
